Which of the following Write Concerns are valid in a 3-node replica set?
w: 0
w: 1
w: majority



For this ticket, you'll be required to increase the durability of the addUser method. Unless you have already changed this method to do so, it should be using the default write concern of w: 1.
When a new user registers for MFlix, their information must be added to the database before they can do anything else. For this reason, we want to make sure that the data written by the addUser method will not be rolled back.
We can decrease the chances of a rollback by increasing the write durability of the addUser method.
Which of the following write concerns are more durable than the default?
WriteConcern.MAJORITY
WriteConcern.W2

New operations can be serviced with pre-existing connections, so a new connection doesn't have to be created each time.
A large influx of operations can be handled more quickly with a pool of existing connections.

When should you set a wtimeout?
When our application is using a Write Concern more durable than w: 1.

Given a replica set with 5 nodes which write concern will cause an error when writing?
7

What of the following is true about Change Streams?
